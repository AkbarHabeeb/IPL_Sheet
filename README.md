## Day 1

In C, if a function signature doesnâ€™t specify any argument, it means that the function can be called with any number of parameters or without any parameters. But, it's not the case in C++ . The same thing holds good for user defined functions as well.

```c
int main() /*Better to use int main(void)*/
{ 
   /* .... */
   return 0; 
}
```
